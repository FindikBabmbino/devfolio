##A Stupid Idea Is Born

Orhan Quest was born out of an assignment, our professor wanted us to write a paper about translation, I wanted to shoot myself, but I thought about it and had the grand idea to turn the tables.
After deciding I wanted do something with games, I thought about what I could talk about, thankfully it was made easier since our teacher courted the topic into just translation, I chose "Using Singleton Pattern To Incorprate Translation".
I did not want this to be a boring paper, there had to something alongside it like a happy meal, I had to make a game.
The name "Orhan Quest" came to me instantly since I knew I wanted to put my professor in the game, original idea was that a character would just walk around and talk to people, but my friend told me that my pixelized character should fight our teacher, It was a funny idea but it just stuck with me so I added that feature.
It features a lot in jokes that nobody will understand, but it is going to be something nostalgic to me in a few years and make me sad, I guess that is a bonus!
