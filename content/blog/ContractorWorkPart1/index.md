## Project 1: C4D

This was for a 3D visualization company in Germany, I was brought in last minute to add UI interactions, player interactions, animation through scripting and web compatibility.

## Project 2: Camera Movement


This was a request from a single developer who was having trouble with camera movements, I wrote a new camera system from scratch that replaced the old script.

## Project 3:Farm game

I was brought into this project to fix the tutorial and make dynamic scriptable object UI's, my main task was to make an UI screen after getting an item, this screen then would display what you found, it had to be something that is universal.
So I used scriptable objects to make it happen, had to overhaul the existing item and item spawn code and had to write new code for the UI.
